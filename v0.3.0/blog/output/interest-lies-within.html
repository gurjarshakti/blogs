    <p>once I was wondering why I am learning to code ? <em>Is it what I was interested in ?</em>
I was better in maths and till date I love to draw . Playing with electronics and reverse engineer them 
was what I did after drawing. In studies the only subject to study was ‘math’ before it came calculus in intermediate
and so  started 'physics'.  Thinking about Applied physics, applying physics everywhere, 
drawing anything that attracts and playing with electronic circuits without knowing anything about electronics 
was what I did. Then, why am I not a B.Sc. Mths/Physics ? Once I planned  for B.Fa at BHU but I never have been there. 
In B.tech I choose CSE instead of EC due to Integrals in math and I don't want to build (draw) circuits on paper. 
Then I went back and started to find out when and where I used to interact with 
Computers and came to conclusion that <em>it was deep inside me</em>. Due to insufficient knowledge and facilities available that
 time I always took the safe way to make career. But eventually <em>I am lucky</em> to find many chances to learn and the passion 
that lie within me for computers makes me do better.Then I concluded it was the thing for what I learned watching someone 
formatting wndows98 and doing it 2 years later. I used a mobile shop’s computer to learn html for class 10th practicals, 3 km 
 far from my PG. My curiosity that how a computer works ? <em>was'n it a sign of interest in computers??</em></p>
