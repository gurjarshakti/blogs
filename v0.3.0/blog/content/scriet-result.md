Summary: How It happend ? someone said "it's hacking", I was like :) Realy??

I built an Web App (hybrid app for Android on JqueryMobile, deployed with cordova) for **SCRIET**, Integrating all the links and pages needed to be accessed for different purposes, as college have different domains (sites).
Result section included a form to retrieve the data from [http://ccsuscriet.org/result2.php](http://ccsuscriet.org/result2.php), when i tried to access my result via app on my mobile it returned with my result.
It was a coincidence that  database was updated for 4th sem result but on college's site [http://ccsuscriet.org/result.php](http://ccsuscriet.org/result.php) form to display result was not updated, that's why I was able to access it a day before it went to college's site.
For easy access I added a page with that form, to my blog with url [http://satyamyadav.info/result](http://satyamyadav.info/result)
