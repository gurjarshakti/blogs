title: About
I am a b.tech pre-final year student. A Linux Geek. I started to code and after that can never have time to think any other thing to do. I don't go 
 in any disciplined manner any time. The best thing in self learnig is *"No target , No tenssion"*.
I only  don't like a thing in studies called *'exams'* and other called *'syllabus'*; why do I need to seat and write what I know in a format and 
size the examinar wants!
what if the best thing I like to know is not in syllabus!
and so there comes 'self learning' and 'open learning'...
**Google is my best teacher and Linux is my best friend !**
I am a FOSS lover and [motivate my friends to use linux](http://satyamyadav.github.io/trylinux) and other open-source softwares and hardwares, always available to help on whatever I can do.

I am all the way ready to chill out with friends any time.
At random I draw ...and listen to music.
